# Trial
A Demo Game

Hello, My name is Filipe Agostinho and I am currently learning Unity and how to code and this is right here is a mini game I created.

I grew up with videogames and my dream is to make my own.

I am also passionate about videogame music as well some of my favorite pieces of music coming from Minecraft, Mario, Sonic, and metal gear

My other dream is to compose music for an industry or make music for myself and post it online for people to enjoy.



The title of this game is Trial and Error

Week 2 goal : figure out some in game issues. Issue 1, the character is infinitely jumping, Issue 2, Collision errors with the platforms
